I was planning on making a fighting game, similar to Mortal Kombat, but after realizing the issues I had with 
pygame and the fact that my original idea was too ambitious, I decided that I will make a meditation app with 
built-in ambient/white noise. I will also incorporate aspects such as a play/pause button, mute button, and
more.
