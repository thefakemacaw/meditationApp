# meditationapp

My project is to build a meditation app using Django. This may not be the most effective way of going about this, but I wanted to try making it a web-based application.

UPDATES:

April 27: I found the Django Intro Tutorial, and am following that for now so I can understand what's happening. Will change things up soon.

April 20: I managed to get my virtual environment working, though I need to figure out where to go from here. I will try to find a tutorial to help me build the app.

April 13: I have managed to resolve the issue by uninstalling Python, removing all Python files in AppData, and then
reinstalling Python 64-bit. Then, I followed https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/ to
check if pip is installed. I have also installed Django. I installed Django and virtualenv, as well as a new directory for the project, though I am still trying to
figure out where to go from here. Right now, when I try to turn on the virtualenv, I get something that says
"'virtualenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

April 6: So far, I have not been able to figure out why my pip was not being seen by python.
