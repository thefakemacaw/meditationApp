# This log is to help me track my progress outside of coding.
''' 
So far, I have not been able to figure out why my pip was not being seen by python.

EDIT: I have managed to resolve the issue by uninstalling Python, removing all Python files in AppData, and then
reinstalling Python 64-bit. Then, I followed https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/ to
check if pip is installed. I have also installed Django.

I installed Django and virtualenv, as well as a new directory for the project, though I am still trying to
figure out where to go from here. Right now, when I try to turn on the virtualenv, I get something that says
"'virtualenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

On the part that says "Creating a Project in Django" in the book (page 400)
