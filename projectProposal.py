1) My project is going to be a meditation web app, hopefully with built in noise
2) My first major milestone is figuring out how to install Django
3) I will need to learn how to use Django and the other tools needed for a web app
4) I wouldn't call this project too ambitious, but figuring out how to make the app function with buttons and sounds and moving images might be a challenge
5) None that I could think of, but I'm worried that my idea is too simple
